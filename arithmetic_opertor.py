x = 32.23

# result = max(x,y,z) #same with min(x,y,z) to fid min
# print(result)

# result = round(x) # give the round of value output is 32 instead of 32.2

# result = abs(z) it converts -8 into positive 8

# print(math.pi)
#print(math.e)

# result = math.sqrt(y)

# result = math.ceil(a) output is 5 where is value is 4.5
# result = math.floor(a) output is 4 where is value is 4.5


# print(result)
